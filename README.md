# XGC-Analysis-Modules

This repo contains various modules for analyzing and visualizing data from the gyrokinetic code XGC. The data, as well as the original code,
are hosted at the Cori supercomputer, where most of the work has been performed and run. The modules were written in the years 2016-2019 and 
are posted here as a reference.
